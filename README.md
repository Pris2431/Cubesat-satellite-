# Cubesat-satellite
If you are programming a Cubesat, here are some of the codes I used that can help read data/ send signals.
-go to Files and under examples, scroll down to LoRa. If you can't find it, it means you haven't downloaded the libraries from Coolterm

-if you can't upload, it means you didn't download the CH340 driver. Under Tools, go to the processor and choose ATmega328P (old bootloader)

START HERE:
-DOWNLOAD ARDUINO
-DOWNLOAD CH341 DRIVER
-DOWNLOAD Coolterm
-Must have your satellite connected

What's included?
- Sending signals to another satellite with LoRa
- Reading ESP and OBS and max satellite temp (displayed in serial monitor when requested)
